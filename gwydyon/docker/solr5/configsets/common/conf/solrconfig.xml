    <!-- AutoCommit

         Perform a hard commit automatically under certain conditions.
         Instead of enabling autoCommit, consider using "commitWithin"
         when adding documents. 

         http://wiki.apache.org/solr/UpdateXmlMessages

         maxDocs - Maximum number of documents to add since the last
                   commit before automatically triggering a new commit.

         maxTime - Maximum amount of time in ms that is allowed to pass
                   since a document was added before automatically
                   triggering a new commit. 
         openSearcher - if false, the commit causes recent index changes
           to be flushed to stable storage, but does not cause a new
           searcher to be opened to make those changes visible.

         If the updateLog is enabled, then it's highly recommended to
         have some sort of hard autoCommit to limit the log size.
     <autoCommit> 
       <maxTime>${solr.autoCommit.maxTime:15000}</maxTime> 
       <openSearcher>false</openSearcher> 
     </autoCommit>
      -->

    <!-- softAutoCommit is like autoCommit except it causes a
         'soft' commit which only ensures that changes are visible
         but does not ensure that data is synced to disk.  This is
         faster and more near-realtime friendly than a hard commit.
     <autoSoftCommit> 
       <maxTime>${solr.autoSoftCommit.maxTime:-1}</maxTime> 
     </autoSoftCommit>

  <!-- To enable dynamic schema REST APIs, use the following for <schemaFactory>:
  
       <schemaFactory class="ManagedIndexSchemaFactory">
         <bool name="mutable">true</bool>
         <str name="managedSchemaResourceName">managed-schema</str>
       </schemaFactory>
       
       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified, Solr will load the schema from
       he resource named in 'managedSchemaResourceName', rather than from schema.xml.
       Note that the managed schema resource CANNOT be named schema.xml.  If the managed
       schema does not exist, Solr will create it after reading schema.xml, then rename
       'schema.xml' to 'schema.xml.bak'. 
       
       Do NOT hand edit the managed schema - external modifications will be ignored and
       overwritten as a result of schema modification REST API calls.

       When ManagedIndexSchemaFactory is specified with mutable = true, schema
       modification REST API calls will be allowed; otherwise, error responses will be
       sent back for these requests.

    <!-- Solr Internal Query Caches

         There are two implementations of cache available for Solr,
         LRUCache, based on a synchronized LinkedHashMap, and
         FastLRUCache, based on a ConcurrentHashMap.  

         FastLRUCache has faster gets and slower puts in single
         threaded operation and thus is generally faster than LRUCache
         when the hit ratio of the cache is high (> 75%), and may be
         faster under other scenarios on multi-cpu systems.
    -->

    <!-- Filter Cache

         Cache used by SolrIndexSearcher for filters (DocSets),
         unordered sets of *all* documents that match a query.  When a
         new searcher is opened, its caches may be prepopulated or
         "autowarmed" using data from caches in the old searcher.
         autowarmCount is the number of items to prepopulate.  For
         LRUCache, the autowarmed items will be the most recently
         accessed items.

         Parameters:
           class - the SolrCache implementation LRUCache or
               (LRUCache or FastLRUCache)
           size - the maximum number of entries in the cache
           initialSize - the initial capacity (number of entries) of
               the cache.  (see java.util.HashMap)
           autowarmCount - the number of entries to prepopulate from
               and old cache.
